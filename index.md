University of Florida club all about making video games. We welcome anyone
interestedâ€”whether artist, programmer, designer, marketer, or if you just have
some ideas and want to talk!

### Here's how it works.

1.  Students who have a game idea pitch it during our Pitch Day towards the
    beginning of the semester.  We'll go over the information to include in the
    pitch during the meeting beforehand.

2.  Students then decide which projects they would like to work on,
    independently breaking into small groups (preferably 3-4 per group).

3.  During weekly meetings, groups will report on their progress and discuss any
    issues they are having.

We will also be arranging guest speakers in the gaming industry occasionally to
discuss issues pertinent to the game industry, students in our club, and
breaking into the game industry.
