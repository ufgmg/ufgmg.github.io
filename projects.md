# Past Projects

## Unity Group

Our group is currently a meeting/discussion group for people trying to learn and
make games using unity. We come from different backgrounds and help each other
out. Please come if you are interested.

## Max's Amazing Group

Our group is working on a game built using RPG Maker. Our game takes on a sci-fi
setting where the protagonist has to battle enemy machines using his own
computer. We've revamped the battle system so that you have to damage machine
enemies by allocating computer programs in a grid that automatically seek out
enemies and do damage upon contact.

## Think Green

Think Green is a puzzle game created for Ludum Dare (a 48-hour game development
competition) by one of our members. The theme of the competition was "small
world." The premise of the game is that you must clean up hazardous waste on a
tiny planet by moving around recyclable waste. The game is written in Python
using Pygame and is open source. You can find more information at
[the game's GitHub repository](https://github.com/kalgynirae/thinking-green).
